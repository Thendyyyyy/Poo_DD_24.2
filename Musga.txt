R u tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I'll fly us out of here

Get a load of this monster
he doesn't know how to communicate 
His mind is in a different place
will everyone give him a little bit of space?

Get a load of this train wreck
his hair's a mess and he  doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know 
The stars welcome him with open arms
